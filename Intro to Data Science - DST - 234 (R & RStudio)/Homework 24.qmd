Homework 24

1.  I liked reading about the artificial neuro networks because it brought up connected graphs and weights which I am going through in my algorithms class right now. Completely different topic but I wonder how I could use machine learning for my weight lifting progress, because I feel like I am rather efficient with my workout but could I somehow enter my workout data into some machine learning algorithm that would predict what weights I should use in the future.
2.  

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

no_arrival <- function(X,Y){
  nycflights13::flights |>
  filter(dest==X,month==Y) |>
  group_by(day) |> 
  summarize(tot=sum(is.na(arr_delay)))
}

no_arrival("ATL",4)

```

3.  I chose to try to link the file to the web instead of reading it in. I think this is what you wanted..???

```{{r}}
library(tidyverse)
library(mosaic)
library(broom)
library(zoo)

fit_lakes <- function(url) {
  lake_data <- read.csv(url, sep = "")
  fit_data <- lake_data |>
    map_dfr(mosaic::fav_stats) |>
    mutate(year = names(lake_data),
         year = str_extract(year, pattern = "(?<=X)[:digit:]+"),
         year = as.numeric(year)) |>
    map_df(zoo::rollmean, k = 5) |>
    select(-n, -missing) |>
    pivot_longer(cols = c("min":"sd"), names_to = "fav_stat", values_to = "value") |>
    group_by(fav_stat) |>
    nest() |>
    mutate(
      lm_fit = map(data, ~ lm(value ~ year, data = .x)),
      lm_summary = map(lm_fit, ~ broom::tidy(.x))
    ) |>
    select(fav_stat, lm_summary) |>
    unnest(cols = c(lm_summary)) |>
    filter(term == "year")

  return(fit_data)
}

fit_lakes("https://www.glerl.noaa.gov/data/ice/glicd/daily/sup.txt")
```
