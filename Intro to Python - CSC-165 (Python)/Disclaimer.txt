Hello Dear Reader,

Unfortuantly I got a new computer shortly 
after finishing my college Python class (CSC-165), and the files got corupted
beyond repair. So all I was able to recover was my Yathzee project, this was one 
of the final projects in the class!

I wish I could show more of my coding progress and journey in Python,
Josh
