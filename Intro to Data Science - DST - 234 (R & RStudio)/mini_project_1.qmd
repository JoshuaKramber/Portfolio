## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

richmondway <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2023/2023-09-26/richmondway.csv')

ggplot(data = richmondway) + geom_point(aes(x = (max(Episode) + 1 * Season + Episode), y = F_count_RK, color = Season)) + labs(title = "Ted Lasso F* Bombs per Episode") + ylab("Roy Kent F**k count") + xlab("Seasons and Episodes")


#Link to the github for another project that I thought was really cool but wouldn't know how to reproduce it https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2023/2023-09-19/pic1.png

#Link to the github for the data https://gist.github.com/zjuul/14bcbcc259429a52e8f87042d004a34c

# I chose this graph because I thought it was funny and would be on the easier side to reproduce. I changed the color to be equal to the season because then we can see which seasons/episodes he says the most F Bombs
```

sables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
