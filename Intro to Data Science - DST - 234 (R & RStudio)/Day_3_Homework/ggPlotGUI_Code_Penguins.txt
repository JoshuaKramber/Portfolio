## You can use the below code to generate the graph.
## Don't forget to replace the 'df' with the name
## of your dataframe

# You need the following package(s):
library("ggplot2")

# The code below will generate the graph:
graph <- ggplot(df, aes(x = body_mass_g, y = bill_length_mm, colour = island)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_grid( species ~ sex ) +
  labs(x = 'Body Mass in g', y = 'Bill Length in mm') +
  ggtitle('Bill Length vs Body mass by Sex and Island for Penguins')+
  labs(colour = 'Island') +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(
    axis.title = element_text(size = 13),
    axis.text = element_text(size = 10),
    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1),
    legend.position = 'right'
  )
graph

# If you want the plot to be interactive,
# you need the following package(s):
library("plotly")
ggplotly(graph)

# If you would like to save your graph, you can use:
ggsave('my_graph.pdf', graph, width = 14, height = 14, units = 'cm')
